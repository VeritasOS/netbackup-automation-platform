# NetBackup Automation Platform

## üöÄ Overview

The NetBackup Automation Platform provides a robust set of Ansible roles and playbooks designed to automate the deployment, configuration, and management of NetBackup environments. Leveraging NetBackup APIs within automation workflows, this project aims to streamline data protection, enhance business resilience, and provide flexibility across various workloads, clouds, and architectures.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This platform offers comprehensive automation capabilities for NetBackup Primary, Media, and Client components:

* **NetBackup Installation & Upgrades**:
    * Fresh installation of NetBackup Client on Windows, SuSE, RHEL, Rocky Linux, and Oracle Linux.
    * Fresh installation of NetBackup Media & Primary servers on SuSE, RHEL, and Oracle Linux.
    * Upgrade NetBackup environments (from and to NB version 10.x onwards).
* **Certificate Management**:
    * Independent certificate deployment, useful for initial setups or adding new primary servers.
* **Component Removal**:
    * Automated removal of NetBackup Client, Media, and Primary components.
* **EEB (Emergency Engineering Binary) Management**:
    * Deployment and management of EEBs with automatic marker creation for easy detection.
    * Supports installing multiple EEBs, upgrading EEBs, adjusting subsequent overlapping EEBs, and removing EEBs.
* **Package Staging**:
    * Option to cache NetBackup packages locally on target hosts for offline installations.
* **Global Security Settings**:
    * Apply global security settings to enhance secure communications.
* **Service Control**:
    * Playbooks to start, stop, and restart NetBackup services.

## üéØ Supported NetBackup Versions

These playbooks support the following NetBackup Primary, Media, and Client versions:

* `11.0.0.1`
* `11.0.0.0`
* `10.5.0.1`

## üõ†Ô∏è Playbooks

All playbooks are designed with Ansible's best practices in mind, offering:

* **Idempotency**: Ensures consistent results and allows for safe re-execution.
* **Task Logging**: Detailed logging for each task for better visibility and troubleshooting.
* **Co-located `ansible.cfg`**: Provides fine-grained control over Ansible behavior.
* **Extensibility**: Easy to integrate new custom roles.

The following table outlines the available playbooks and their functionalities, grouped for easier navigation:

## üöÄ Getting Started with NetBackup Ansible Playbooks

### Requirements/Prerequisites

Before running the playbooks, ensure the following:

1.  **Ansible Core**: Supports `ansible-core 2.15` onwards.
2.  **Ansible Automation Platform**: Must be configured and ready for use.
3.  **Non-interactive Connection**: Establish a non-interactive connection to all managed nodes/target hosts.
4.  **Artifact Repository Manager**: Configure an artifact repository manager (e.g., a yum repository) and upload all NetBackup RPMs with their respective repodata. This can be a web server accessible via URL, or a local/mounted file-system path.
    * **Client RPMs**: `<NB_Package_DIR>/NetBackup_<NB_VERSION>_CLIENTS2/NBClients/anb/Clients/usr/openv/netbackup/client/Linux/RedHat3.10.0`
    * **Primary/Media RPMs**: `<NB_Package_DIR>/NetBackup_<NB_VERSION>_LinuxR_x86_64/linuxR_x86/anb`
    * **Client Windows DVD Packages**: `<NB_Package_DIR>/NetBackup_<NB_VERSION>_Win\`
    * **ITA Data Collector (for Primary server)**: `<NB_Package_DIR>/NetBackup_<NB_VERSION>_LinuxR_x86_64/linuxR_x86/catalog/anb/ita_dc.tar.gz`
5.  **Ansible Inventory**: Ensure the Ansible inventory is pre-populated with your target hosts.


### Usage

Once all prerequisites are met, follow these steps to execute the playbooks:

#### Using Ansible CLI

Playbook execution requires certain mandatory variables.

1.  **Update Variables**:
    * Modify the template files `vars/linux.yml` (for Linux) or `vars/win32nt.yml` (for Windows) directly. These files are already included in all playbooks, so changes will be automatically picked up.
    * **Alternatively**, you can specify variables using the `--extra-vars` argument in JSON format, as supported by Ansible CLI.
2.  **Execute Playbook**: Run the `ansible-playbook` CLI command from the playbook's directory.

    * **Example (Linux with `vars/linux.yml` modified)**:
        ```bash
        [user@host ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook_install_client_linux.yml -l linux -vv
        ```
    * **Example (Windows with `vars/win32nt.yml` modified)**:
        ```bash
        [user@host ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook_install_client_windows.yml -l win -vv
        ```
    * **Example (Linux with `--extra-vars`)**:
        ```bash
        [user@host ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook_install_client_linux.yml -l linux -vv --extra-vars="nbu_version=10.3.0.0 os_path_nbu_install=/usr/openv"
        ```
    * **Example (Windows with `--extra-vars`)**:
        ```bash
        [user@host ~]$ ansible-playbook playbook_install_client_windows.yml -l win -vv --extra-vars="nbu_version=10.3.0.0 os_path_nbu_install=C:\Program Files\Veritas"
        ```

#### From within the Ansible Automation Platform (e.g., AWX)

(At the time of this documentation, AWX is considered the web interface for managing the Ansible Automation Platform.)

1.  **AWX Configuration**: Ensure AWX is installed and initially configured:
    * Inventories are configured, and all target hosts are added with required credentials.
    * The project is created and synced using a supported Source Control Type.
2.  **Templates**:
    * AWX templates (also known as Ansible Tower Job Templates) are reusable blueprints for automating tasks.
    * Create a template and specify the project, inventory, and playbook to run.
    * If `vars/linux.yml` or `vars/win32nt.yml` is modified locally, the "Variables" field in the template can be left empty.
    * Otherwise, copy the entire content from the respective `vars` file and paste it into the "Variables" section in YAML format, updating values as needed for your environment.
3.  **Launch Template**: Launch the required template to begin playbook execution.
